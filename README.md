# Polygon FA
Polygon FA is a fictional Fund Accounting group within a large Fund Accounting department of an international administrator.
Fund Accounting is the process of calculating a NAV (Net Asset Value) per share for an Investment Fund and publishing that price in the financial markets.
The aim of this site is to streamline the allocation process on occasions of annual leave and illness.
These occasions can be time consuming and cause conflict when processes are allocated to people who were not expecting them and are therefore unprepared.
The site will allow users to see what they are allocated in advance and prepare and will also enable the planners to save time through not having to update excel spreadsheets every week. 
Please see user stories below for specific issues.

### User Stories

### FA Team Leader
As a user I need to be prepared to cover any additional funds that I may be allocated on a given day.
I know what I will be doing everyday when everyone is in but in times of vacation or illness I will be allocated extra and I don't want to be surprosed on the day.
I need to know those additional funds to safeguard myself and the company from costly errors and to complete them in a timely fashion.
I aslo want to be able to easily see if any colleagues have booked vacation time as a maximum of 2 people are allowed leave at the same time. 

### FA Manager
As a user I need to ensure that every fund is allocated to a reviewer. At the moment I use a spreadsheet which I update weekly and can take significant time when people are going to be out of office in busy holiday periods. I would like a more efficient process that removes the need for me to think about who is going to do what, if they are comfortable with it and if they require cross training.  
Publishing an incorrect NAV can cause significant financial and reputational damage and I would like to have a tool whickh would enab;e my staff my staff to get comfortable in advance on funds where they are first and second cover. Each of them are expert at their own specific group of clients.
I also would like to maintain the annual leave for the team online. A maximum of 2 people are allowed at the same time and I and the assistant manager cannot be off at the same time. Annual leave are currently maintained on spreadsheet and can be difficult to read. 
Each fund will follow public holidays of a specific country/countries. Currently we monitor them manually and update the excel allocation spreadsheet when necessary. I would like to add the holidays to a tool at the start of the year perhaps and check them periodically, taking much of the manual work out of maintaing a spreadsheet application.
To sum up I would like to have all the factors influencing the daily allocation, leave, public holidays and illness available on one intuitive tool to save time and reduce risk.
